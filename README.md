*   **License:** Fusion grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use on devices that you own or control, subject to these Terms.
*   **Functionality:** Fusion is a content organization and discovery application that integrates with third-party services and user-installed addons.

## 2. User Responsibilities

*   **Compliance with Laws:** You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of Fusion, including any content accessed or activity undertaken, complies with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations in your jurisdiction. You acknowledge that Fusion is a tool, and you are responsible for how you choose to use it.
*   **Third-Party Services:** When you connect Fusion to third-party services (e.g., Trakt, TMDB, MDBList), you are subject to the terms of service and privacy policies of those respective services. Fusion is not responsible for the content, policies, or practices of third-party services. Your decision to connect such services is your own.
*   **Addons:** Fusion allows users to install third-party addons from user-provided URLs. These addons are not developed, vetted, or endorsed by Fusion unless explicitly stated.
    *   You are solely responsible for the addons you choose to install, configure, and use. This includes responsibility for the source of the addon, its content, its functionality, and its security.
    *   You must ensure that your use of any addon, and any content or services accessed through it, complies with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction and the terms of service of any content sources the addon accesses. Fusion has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, legality, security, or privacy practices of third-party addons or the data they may transmit or request.
    *   By installing an addon, you acknowledge that you are directing Fusion to interact with the addon's specified endpoints and to handle data as instructed by that addon, at your sole discretion and risk.
*   **Prohibited Conduct:** You agree not to use Fusion for any purpose that is illegal, infringes on the rights of others (including intellectual property rights), or is prohibited by these Terms.
